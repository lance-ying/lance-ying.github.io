## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student affiliated with the Intelligent Interactive System Group at Harvard University and Computational Cognitive Science Lab at MIT. I'm advised by Krzysztof Gajos and Josh Tenenbaum. My research interests are in the intersection between cognitive science and Human-AI interaction, such as accessible computing, social robotics, adaptive interface, etc.. I'm particularly interested in the role of mental model and theory-of-mind in human-AI collaboration.

## Research Interests

- **HCI:** Social Robotics, Adaptive Interface, Accessibility
- **Cognitive Science:** Theory-of-Mind, Bayesian Inference, Goal Inference, Probabilistic Programming
